			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<center>
			<div>
				<h3>SWIPE CARD</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Swiping the card is a short task located within the admin room on the center's right side table's right side. This task requires the player to take a card from their wallet and swipe it across the terminal. The player must take caution to swipe the card at just the right speed. However, they will fail and repeat the task if they swipe too fast or too slow. Also, players will receive a "bad read" message if they do not swipe the card all the way.</p>
					<p>Note: This task applies to all players. If available in the Ship, then ALL Crewmates must have it.</p>
					<p>If not available, then NONE of Crewmates should perform it. In these situations, a non-experienced Impostor can be easily found out by committing this mistake.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>CHART COURSE</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<img src="images/Skeld/Chart_Course.PNG" class="task_img" align="left">
					<p>This is a short task located in Navigation, which requires you to center a pointer randomly deviated from the center. By placing this pointer into the center, the lines would glow green, meaning it was a success.</p>
				</div>
				</br>
				<h3>DIVERT POWER</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Divert power requires the player to divert power, which is based on electricity, and then requires the player to accept the diverted power, which depends on the task prompt.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>CALIBRATE DISTRIBUTOR</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>The player needs to press a button to match three spinning "generators" at the right timing; each "generator" has its color and speed. Once the player fails to match one of them correctly, the task will restart.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>CLEAN O2 FILTER</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>This requires the player to pull leaves from the air and shove them into a chute, where they are supposedly disposed of.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>EMPTY GARBAGE</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<img src="images/Skeld/Empty_Garbage.PNG" class="task_img" align="right">
					<p>Emptying the ship's garbage is a task that requires the player to empty garbage from two different disposals: one that is located within the Cafeteria on the north-eastern wall and one that is located within the storage room on the south-eastern room. The player must hold down the lever on the right-hand of the garbage in the disposal that has been discarded. Both garbage disposals must be emptied to complete this task. The garbage chute in the storage room is also a visual task seen as the garbage would be released from the chute into space.</p>
					<p>Emptying the chute is the same task as emptying the garbage, but the start is located on the left wall of the O2 room and ends in the bottom right of the storage room. You must empty both chutes to complete the task. There are only two possible starts for emptying the garbage the one in the O2 room and the one in the Cafeteria. The last one is always in the storage room.</p>
					<p>Note: The storage room disposal contains a diamond and a teleporter. They are easter eggs from The Henry Stickmin Collection, another game by Innersloth. However, the chute must be emptied regardless of completing the task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>FIX WIRING</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>This task has three parts, and all you are needed to do is connect the similarly colored wire ends. When all four have been (correctly) placed, that panel is done.</p>
					<p>The rules for the order in which the panels must be done are very complicated. There is more information on the page dedicated to this task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>ALIGN ENGINE OUTPUT</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Aligning the output of the engines is a task that is located within both engine rooms. In this task, the player must adjust and hold the engine's direction until it matches the horizontal line in the middle of the screen. After holding for several seconds, the engine will align. Players must align both the upper and lower engine to complete this task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>INSPECT SAMPLE</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Inspecting the sample is a task located within the computer on the right wall of MedBay. In this task, players must perform a chemical reaction to identify an abnormality in the samples. Players must press the button on the lower right-hand corner to begin the reaction, which takes about a minute to perform. During this wait time, players complete other tasks or check the security cameras for impostors during this wait time.</p>
					<p>After the reaction has been completed, the player must identify the abnormal sample. Simply press the green button below the red colored sample to complete the task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>UPLOAD DATA</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<img src="images/Skeld/Upload_Data.PNG" class="task_img" align="left">
					<p>Uploading data requires the player to first download data, in which the location depends on the task prompt. Downloading data takes approximately 8.5 seconds. The data then must be uploaded in Admin, which takes the same amount of time.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>SUBMIT SCAN</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Submitting a scan is a task that is located on a circular platform in MedBay. In this task, players must do a body scan by stepping onto the platform and let a green, holographic scanner analyze your player. When mounting the platform, a pop up will appear, as if it is gathering information. It takes 10 seconds to scan the player. If you step off the platform too early, by pressing the "X" on the top left of the pop-up, it will cancel the task and reset your timer.</p>
					<p>Impostors cannot act like they are submitting a scan, as only Crewmates can show the holographic scanner.</p>

			<h2>Tasks</h2>
			<center>
			<div>
				<h3>SCAN BOARDING PASS</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Located in Office, the player must flip a card to its left side and place it on the scanner to be verified and completed. This is a common task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>SWIPE CARD</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Swiping the card is a short task located within the Office at the device that looks like a printer. This task requires the player to take a card from their wallet and swipe it across the terminal. The player must take caution to swipe the card at just the right speed, however, they will fail and repeat the task if they swipe too fast or too slow. Also, players will receive a "bad read" message if they do not swipe the card all the way.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>INSERT KEYS</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<img src="images/Polus/Insert_Keys.png" class="task_img" align="left">
					<p>This common task is located in the Dropship, where the players spawn at the start of the game. To complete it, one must take a key from their keychain and insert it into the highlighted hole. Two players cannot have the same hole. Note that while only Crewmates can see which hole they are assigned, ALL players are assigned one, and as such, Impostors have one assigned as well. This can blow The Impostor's cover very easily. The holes are not selected at random but based on spawning order, which you can see on vitals as the order players appear. Counting from the top, left column, down, the holes are numbered in order. The hole selected coincides with the player's spawn position, as in the player who entered the game first will always get the top left hole. This can expose Impostors instantly and easily.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>REPLACE WATER JUG</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>This is a long task. To complete this task, the player must first go to the Boiler Room and fill up a water jug by holding down the button until all of the water is transferred from the jug's right side to the left. The player must do the same thing in Office after the first stage is complete.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>REPAIR DRILL</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>This is a short task located near Laboratory, and it is located in a separate room outside, located from which looks like a rocket. Repair Drill involves repeatedly clicking on four red exclamation points, with the markers reducing in size each time and eventually disappearing. Once each exclamation mark has vanished, and the bottom of the screen reads "STATUS: GOOD," the task is completed.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>RECORD TEMPERATURE</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>This is a short task located either near Office (near the lava pit) or Laboratory. A Crewmate assigned with this task must enter the temperature number that the task asks for on the right and click/hold on the arrows to increase or decrease the number that is currently displayed. In the version of this task located on the Exterior, the number must be increased, but it must be lowered in the Laboratory. You are allowed to hold either of the arrow buttons to exponentially increase the temperature's pace, whether it be to decrease it or increase it.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>REBOOT WIFI</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>The Crewmate with this task must go to Communications and find the communication box. The screen will read "Reboot Required." The player must pull the lever, which will begin a 60-second countdown process. The Wi-Fi will power off, and the "Tasks" tab will display the remaining amount of seconds left in the countdown, along with the screen. The player does not have to remain in Communications during the countdown, and they may perform other tasks during this time.</p>
					<p>After the countdown reaches 0, the Crewmate must return to Communications to pull the lever back up to power on the Wi-Fi. The Crewmate must wait for 3 seconds for all the lights to blink on. Then this will complete the task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>CLEAR ASTEROIDS</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>This is a visual/short task in Polus, located in Weapons. The Crewmate's goal is to shoot the meteors, which appear on the screen up to 20 times; while this is going on outside the weapons, you can see an animation of the laser being shot as the Crewmate does the task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>FILL CANISTERS</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<img src="images/Polus/Fill_Canisters.PNG" class="task_img" align="right">
					<p>The player must drag the canister to the airway to fill it up with gas, then pull it away from the airway. This must be done for two canisters.</p>
					<p>If they leave the task after filling the first canister, the task will not be reset. Instead, the text in the task list will become yellow, just like any other multi-stage task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>STORE ARTIFACTS</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>In-Store Artifacts, Crewmates have four different objects and a case with four holes that are the same shapes as the objects. To complete the task, they have to put all objects into the holes with the same shape. When you leave the task incomplete, the task resets as all four holes must be filled in with the correct shape/artifact.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>OPEN WATERWAYS</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>Crewmates must travel to the Boiler Room in the bottom left of Polus to begin this task. Stage 1 consists of opening the valve on the left. Stage 2 consists of opening the valve on the right. Stage 3 consists of opening the last valve outside, near the entrance to Office/Admin. All valves must be turned counterclockwise. When a Crewmate turns the valve, they must wait until the water reaches the bar's very tip located at the right. The progress in the bar of water is saved even when you leave the task.</p>
				</div>
				<h3>ALIGN TELESCOPE</h3>
				<div class="task">
					<p>The task involves moving the telescope until it is pointed at whichever the correct astronomical object is. A slight beeping/ticking sound will increase in speed as you get closer to the right object. A few of the things you must identify are one of which follows; Black Hole, Dyson Sphere, Alien Spaceship, Gas Giant, A Galaxy, and Another Planet.</p>
